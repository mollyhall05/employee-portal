# Employee Portal üöÄ

This is a simple **Employee Portal** built with **React (Vite)**. It includes a login page and an employee dashboard where users can view their work schedule, submit leave requests, update their personal information, view notifications and submit expenses. There is also a separate manager dashboard where management staff can approve or reject leave requests and expense requests from employees, and send company-wide notifications.
